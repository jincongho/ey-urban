# EY NEXTWAVE DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGE 2019 - Predicting Traffic in Georgia City Center from Geolocation Records 

In this competition, we'll aim to predict how many people are in the city centre between 15:00 and 16:00. The given dataset consists of 210,000 devices (each with 1~20 straight-line trajectories) and 11 columns. My final prediction model is built with a Gradient Boosting Tree (XGBoost) and achieved Public LB f1 score 0.88539 (ranked 2nd in finalist presentation round, 3rd in model performance in the UK and 27th globally).
